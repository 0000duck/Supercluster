# Supercluster
A .NET machine learning focusing on [clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) and [metric learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_learning).
Currently I am just starting out, but I plan to focus on algorithms that are new (such as the ENN algorithm) as well as old classics (such as DBSCAN). The project is under heavy development and I have *many* things planed.


##Algorithms
Here is a list of currently supported algorithms:

* [k-NN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)
* [ENN](http://www.ele.uri.edu/faculty/he/PDFfiles/ENN.pdf) (1st C# implementation)
* [k-Means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)

## Next Release

### Algorithms 
* [DBSCAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN)
* [OPTICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPTICS_algorithm)

### Code
* Refactor of the ENN code.
* A KD-Tree implementation.
* Updating kNN, kMmeans and ENN to use a KD-Tree
